This is a implementation of decision tree. 

student.py is the main file.

--data is the data csv file path given.
the csv should be in the format: att0, att1,....,attn, output.

The model prints out the decision tree in the format as following:

level, node, entropy, type_of_node.

An example is as follows:
0, root, 0.60287, no_leaf
        or 
5, att4=big, 0, vgood.
